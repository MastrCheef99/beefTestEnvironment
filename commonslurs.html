      <h1>Why are some slurs socially acceptable?</h1>
      <p>If you've ever been to middle or high school, you know that teens like to curse. We all try to "one-up" each other in or cursing game. My line was cunt<br>
      but one of my friends has taken up the n word. Everyone's like "ayo that's racist" but to certain slurs, no one cares. Let's go case by case with a few slurs<br></p>
      <h2>Faggot</h2>
      <p>Faggot is a homophobic slur that even I would use a few times in my day. Once my friend told me they were likely gay or bi,<br>
      I pretty much dropped this word from my vocabulary. But why is this so commonly acceptable? In the words of the grat idubbbz<br>
      he said something like "why are all these slurs ok? does the n word just sound more guttural?" I can think of no logical conclusion.</p>
      <h2>Retard, Sped, and Autistic (as a way to call someone dumb)</h2>
      <p>Now I know that 2 of those aren't actually slur but I would like to touch on them I have a definitive answer for the first. Retard is an ableist slur against autistic people and really any mentally handicapped people.<br>
      I know that a lot of people don't know that retard is a slur and just think it means dumb. Now sped and autistic, I have no excuse for that. Do you think they're that stupid.</p>
      <img src="img/harold.jpg">
      <p>Look into this man's EYES and tell him if they are that fucking stupid. Do you really think they think sped (Special Ed) and autistic means dumb. A fucking disorder (disease?) you are born with and can't get rid of and a class for people with that.<br>
      I just don't like that. It's a problem. Next time one of my friends says anything like that, I wont stand for it. I will tell them "young man do you really think that's ok say? How would you feel hearing that as an actual kid with autism. Fuck you, CUNT."</p>
      <h2>Slurs I could say in front of most people</h2>
      <p>Cracker, Zipperhead, and probably beaner. (I know my friend says all of those)
