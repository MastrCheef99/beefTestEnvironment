      <h1>4/28/2023</h1>
      <p>So I haven't written in a while and I have some shit to catch you up on. The first concerns my hacking competition.<br></p>
      <h2>Part 1: Hacking Competition</h2>
      <p>So recently, I got into a hacking competition (teams) with 3 of my friends. We are trying to hack each other's google accounts. Here's the teams.<br>
      the first team is me and Chris. I am pretty good at social engineering and planning, while Chris knows how to develop viruses for windows. I wont say too<br>
      more in case the other team is reading this, but Chris is letting me use his linode account. The other team, let's call them S and M. S is a good developer<br>
      but I don't think he knows viruses. He has a leg up as he uses linux which is harder to develop for. That is why with the og virus plan, when it was a 1v1v1<br>
      was to target M. He isn't very good with cybersecurity or hacking, but I'm sure he knows something. He uses windows so I wanted Chris when he wasn't on my team yet<br>
      to develop a virus against him. His shitty self leaked my plan to S and M so I couldn't use it. It involved telling M I had his password so he would run an .exe disguised at a .txt<br>
      My first lead was M's pwnage, as he was in the Promo breach. Sadly, passwords were encrypted and salted in SHA-256 so the lead went dry. Side note: I would've had to use BreachForums<br>
      which is down since the pompompurin situation. That's all I can say for now on the hacking.<br><p>
      <h2>Part 2: BOTW</h2>
      <p>As you probably know, there are 2 weeks until TOTK releases and I want to replay BOTW before then. I did Vah Ruta so far and I want to beat the rest of them this weekend.<br>
      My friend, let's call him B, lost his Switch. Once I finish, I want to let him borrow my whole Switch with BOTW so he can beat it also. This is illegal, but I may back up TOTK so he can play it on yuzu or ryujinx.<br>
      Not sure though. After I beat BOTW and TOTK, I'm going to emulate OoT and MM. Let's not get ahead of ourselves though. End day.</p>
